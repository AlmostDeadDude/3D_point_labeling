00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.740
Hello and welcome

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.880
During this task, you will be asked to review

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.550
a certain amount of points

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.109
Those points are from the point clouds

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.120
which are ultimately representing pieces of urban areas

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.150
Each step has one point highlighted with yellow

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.520
Your task is to decide, which class does this point represent

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.770
You can zoom in 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.970
or rotate the point cloud using your mouse

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.710
Use the buttons on the right side

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.060
to indicate your decision and navigate to the next case

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.560
New tasks might take some time to appear

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.550
Note, that there are some control tasks and attention checks

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.050
They mirror the checks used on the original crowdsourcing platform

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.840
But if you simply pay attention to the task

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.940
such problems will be avoided

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.060
After you are done with the last point

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.550
the button down right will appear

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.820
Use it to finish the task and get your proof code

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.380
Thats it. Good luck!
